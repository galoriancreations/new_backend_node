The man responsible was the late John Martin, former director of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory, who discovered that sprinkling iron dust in the right ocean waters could trigger plankton blooms the size of a small city. In turn, the billions of cells produced might absorb enough heat-trapping carbon dioxide to cool the Earth‚Äôs warming atmosphere.

After Phytoplankton die, or are consumed, most are remineralized at the surface, recycling nutrients and Carbon. 4. Others sink to depth before being remineralized in the deep ocean on in marine sediments. 5.

Ask, declare, listen, smile more, start living, and see how you manage to grow each day with the choices and decisions you make, the way you spend your time, the people you hang out with and how you feel at any given moment.\nFor me, sustainability is first and foremost listening to the inner self, heart and mind, for me sustainability is living in the beings I have chosen for myself, joy, giving and listening, it all comes down to that.\nI want to thank you again for participating in the challenge,\nWe are almost done ... another step and we reached the depths of this small and big journey.\nIn fact let's walk 18 festive steps, a reminder of our joint journey together. Imagine what kind of world you would like to live in? I would love to hear that in the group or in private,\n\"You may say I'm dreamer\nBut I'm not the only one\nI hope one day you will join me\nAnd the world will be as one\" ~ John Lenon",
